# styles-conference-site-shayhowe

### Project built as I progress through Shay Howe's CSS and HTML course. [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

**Tools Used**: HTML5, CSS3

**Description**:
A Home landing page along with Speaker, Schedule, Venue, and Register pages for the Styles Conference. I used semantic HTML5 code to build the structure and content of each page. The HTML is styled with an external CSS file. I used the Box Model's principles to design the layout in CSS.
